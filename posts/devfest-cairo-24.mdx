### Demystifying OAuth2 & OIDC by Nejmeddine BEN OUARRED

Nejmeddine BEN OUARRED delivered a fascinating talk where he demystified the architecture of **OAuth2** and **OIDC** (OpenID Connect), using an analogy to the **Cairo Metro System** to make the concepts engaging and easier to understand.

He broke down how each system works:

1. **OAuth2**  
   OAuth2 acts like a **ticketing system** in the metro. Just as you need a valid ticket to pass through the gates and access the metro system, applications need an **access token** to access resources securely. It ensures that only authorized individuals (or applications) can use specific services.

2. **OIDC**  
   OpenID Connect, built on top of OAuth2, is akin to a **metro card with your photo and personal details**. It not only allows you access to the metro but also confirms your identity. OIDC adds an authentication layer, enabling systems to verify **who you are** while using the token for secure access.

Through this analogy, Nejmeddine highlighted how OAuth2 focuses on **authorization** (what you can do), while OIDC adds **authentication** (who you are).

His creative approach made these technical concepts relatable and memorable for the audience.

### From an Engineer to a Founder by Abdalah AbuHashem, nSave Founder

## Secondary Stage Wrap

### Prompt Engineering: Strategies for Better Results by Islam Mahmoud
Islam Mahmoud delivered a practical and insightful session on crafting better prompts to achieve faster and more accurate results when working with language models. He shared several effective strategies:

1. **Adding a Persona**: By specifying the context or the audience, prompts can produce highly tailored outputs. For instance:

<CodeBlock lang="text" code={`- Explain Flutter
- Act as a senior software engineer and explain Flutter to a junior developer
- Act as a senior software engineer and explain Flutter to a senior backend engineer`}/>

   Each prompt yields different results based on the specified persona and audience.

2. **Breaking Tasks into Steps**: For complex tasks, Mahmoud recommended breaking them down into smaller steps. For example, if you're processing audio data:
   - Provide the language model with a step-by-step guide, such as extracting the transcript first, followed by text processing.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: He emphasized re-iterating prompts to focus on specific aspects of the task. For instance:

<CodeBlock lang="text" code={`- Explain React
- Explain React to a junior developer
- Explain React to a junior developer with a focus on functional components and hooks`}/>

   Re-iterating helps to refine the response and align it with the exact requirements.

4. **Adjusting Model Parameters**: Mahmoud discussed using **temperature values** to control creativity:
   - `0` for deterministic, consistent results.
   - `1` for creative outputs.  
   He also highlighted limiting response length (number of tokens) to reduce costs, especially when using paid models. For example, asking **Gemini** to `write a one-sentence definition for DevOps` can save both time and money.

5. **Providing Schemas for Structured Outputs**: To ensure concise and relevant responses, he recommended defining output schemas. As an example, he shared how he built an app to extract only the necessary information from real estate agent messages for him and his wife to compare properties. A structured prompt might look like:

<CodeBlock lang="text" code={`Write a SQL script to select all the products with a price less than $100. Return only the SQL.`}/>

Mahmoud's talk was a treasure trove of practical tips for maximizing the potential of language models while optimizing efficiency and cost.

## Introduction

Ever noticed how fast a single web page loads? How is it possible for a web page whose web-servers
might be miles and miles away from your machine loads almost instantaneously? It makes you think:
are our machines directly connected to our favorite website's servers? The answer is no, they are
not.

When you are on the internet, requests sent from your machine don't reach the destination computer
in a single jump or a **hop**. However, it follows a unique route through strategically and
physically interconnected computer networks around the world called **The Internet Backbone** in
order to help you receive and transmit requests and information.

If you navigate to [Submarine Cable Map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/), you'll be able to
view the locations of these networks, and how they are interconnected.

Another way to look at it is the [Opte Project's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opte_Project) visual representation
of the internet. One of its visualizations is the following image which
portrays a portion of the internet in 2005 in which each line is connected
between nodes that represent two different IP addresses. How awesome is that
ðŸ˜®.

Sometimes you may wanna know what that route is, and that's where
**traceroute** steps in.

## Traceroute

Traceroute is a procedure that enables you to precisely figure out how data
transmission travels from one machine to another. Basically, it compiles a
list of the computers on the network that are involved with an internet
activity and identifies each computer or a server on that list and the time
data took to get from one machine to another. If any interruption happens in
the transfer of data, the traceroute shows you where the problem occurred
along the chain.

In order to perform a traceroute, open up your terminal and write down the
following command:

```txt
- traceroute HOSTNAME if you're a Mac or Linux user.
- tracert HOSTNAME if you're a Windows user.
```

For example, Let's try and traceroute `google.com`:

/>

We got that google's IP address is `142.250.200.238`, so were we to enter that
IP address in the browser's address bar and hit go, we should redirected to
Google.com web page.

## Summary

Traceroute is always a practical way if you're finding difficulty accessing a
particular website. It helps in finding out where the problem is occurring in
the network.

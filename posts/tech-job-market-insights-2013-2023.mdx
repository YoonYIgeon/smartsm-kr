### Growth and Expansion (2013-2018)

The early part of the decade saw substantial growth in the tech job market. The rise of cloud computing, mobile technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning drove a high demand for skilled professionals. Traditional tech hubs like the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and New York City thrived, while emerging hubs such as Austin, Miami, and Salt Lake City began to gain prominence.

### COVID-19 Impact (2020-2021)

The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant disruptions to the tech job market. Hiring slowed temporarily as companies adapted to remote work. However, the demand for IT support, cybersecurity, and infrastructure roles surged as businesses transitioned online. While traditional big tech companies saw a decline in job postings, smaller companies and startups increased their hiring to meet new demands.

### Post-Pandemic Rebound (2021)

The tech job market rebounded strongly in 2021, with job advertisements nearly doubling compared to 2019 and 2020. Remote work opportunities diversified job locations, reducing the dominance of traditional tech hubs and increasing hiring in emerging tech centers.

### Layoffs and Market Adjustments (2022-2023)

Despite the strong rebound, 2022 and 2023 witnessed notable layoffs, particularly among major firms like Meta, Google, and Amazon. These layoffs resulted from over-hiring during the pandemic, economic uncertainties, and shifting business priorities. Nonetheless, the demand for tech roles in AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity remained high.

### Impact of AI Coding/Design Tools

The rise of AI coding and design tools using Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly influenced the tech job market. These tools have automated many routine coding tasks, increasing productivity but reducing the need for junior and mid-level developers. Companies have adjusted their hiring strategies, focusing on fewer but more specialized roles, contributing to recent layoffs as they streamline operations to leverage these advanced tools effectively.

## Key Data Points

**- High Growth Roles**: Product Management, UI/UX Design, IT Support.
**- Moderate Growth Roles**: Infrastructure Engineering, Project Management, Information Security.
**- Emerging Fields**: AI, machine learning, tech process automation.

The tech job market dynamics have also been influenced by the increasing number of CS/IT graduates. Over the last decade, there has been a significant rise in the number of graduates entering the job market, leading to higher competition for entry-level positions. This influx has created a supply-demand imbalance, putting pressure on the job market and making it challenging for new graduates to secure positions.
